## Local Development

### Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies. This project uses pnpm for package management.
You can find [info about and install it here](https://pnpm.io/).

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Production

Build the application for production. This isn't a complicated app so
using Nuxt's static site generation is plenty.

```bash
pnpm generate
```
